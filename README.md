## Inspect CLS with calm

Sometimes when I'm inspecting a website and having multiple CLS changes at once, I couldn't find a way to stop each frame of layout shift and inspect it closely with Inspector tools

## Extension Icon Menu

TODO: Add Images

**Reload and Record** - Refreshes a new window and immediately start recording

**Record** - Start tracking the CLS occurring in the moment

**Stop** - Don't record more and go to the Inspector page

### Inspector page

TODO: Add Images

**Frame bar** - Useful for toggling manually clicking into each frame

**Web Inspector** - It's the exact HTML that was in the document when an CLS happened
